# 📡 Comprehensive IPC Framework Simulation

A fully functional web-based Inter-Process Communication (IPC) framework that demonstrates real-world process communication techniques including:

- **Pipes**
- **Message Queues**
- **Shared Memory**
- **Security Features** (Authentication, Encryption, Logging)

This project provides both:
1. **Interactive Visual Simulation (Web UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**
2. **Real C Programming IPC Implementations** *(for documentation/demo use)*

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a conceptual and interactive framework where multiple processes can communicate:
- Efficiently  
- Securely  
- With data integrity  
- Preventing unauthorized access

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pipes Simulation | Two-way chat between Process A & B |
| Message Queues | FIFO queue operations with enqueue/dequeue |
| Shared Memory | Live updating shared memory value |
| Security Layer | Encryption, audit logs, controlled communication |
| Activity Logs | Tracks every IPC operation with timestamp |
| Typing Indicator | Real-time feedback for user experience |
| Reset System | Clears queue, memory, and logs instantly |

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **HTML** | Structure & pages |
| **CSS (Glass UI Theme)** | Design & animations |
| **JavaScript** | IPC simulation logic & state handling |
| **C Language** | Real OS-level IPC Code (for documentation) |
